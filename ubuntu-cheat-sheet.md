## üñ•Ô∏è Deleting Lines in the Terminal CLI

When working in the terminal on Unix-like systems (such as Ubuntu), you may need to delete lines that you've typed. Here are some quick commands to help you do that:

### For Bash and Zsh Shells

1. **Delete the Current Line**:
   - **Delete to the Beginning**: Press `Ctrl` + `U` to delete everything from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
   - **Delete to the End**: Press `Ctrl` + `K` to delete everything from the cursor to the end of the line.

2. **Delete the Entire Line**:
   - Move to the beginning of the line by pressing `Ctrl` + `A`, then press `Ctrl` + `K` to delete the line.
   - Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl` + `U` directly to delete the entire line.

### Confirming Deletion

After using these shortcuts, if you press `Enter`, the line will not be executed since it has been cleared. These shortcuts are useful for quickly removing text without executing unwanted commands.

Feel free to use these methods to manage your command input efficiently!
