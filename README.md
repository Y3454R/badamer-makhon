# My Learning Journal ü•ú

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of my daily learnings in technology. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources that reflect my progress and insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to manage the build process of software using compiler-independent configuration files. It generates platform-specific build scripts, such as Makefiles for Linux or project files for IDEs like Visual Studio, from a single set of configuration files. I can learn from [here](https://cmake.org/getting-started/).

## üß† Keras

Keras is a high-level deep learning API that allows users to easily build, train, and deploy neural networks. It abstracts many low-level details of neural networks and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for complex tasks. [Explore](https://www.notion.so/Keras-e2587ac62cf14f1aa3bf410feaf480b4).
