# My Learning Journal ü•ú

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of my daily learnings in technology. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources that reflect my progress and insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to manage the build process of software using compiler-independent configuration files. It generates platform-specific build scripts, such as Makefiles for Linux or project files for IDEs like Visual Studio, from a single set of configuration files. I can learn from [here](https://cmake.org/getting-started/).

## üß† Keras

Keras is a high-level deep learning API that allows users to easily build, train, and deploy neural networks. It abstracts many low-level details of neural networks and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for complex tasks. [Explore](https://www.notion.so/Keras-e2587ac62cf14f1aa3bf410feaf480b4).

## üî¶ Lidar

Lidar is a method for determining ranges by targeting an object or a surface with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar)

## üõ£Ô∏è Lin‚ÄìKernighan Algorithm

The Lin‚ÄìKernighan algorithm is a powerful heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This algorithm is designed to find a near-optimal solution through iterative local optimization techniques.

### Key Features

- **Two-Opt and Three-Opt**: Builds on the principles of the 2-opt and 3-opt methods, enhancing flexibility by allowing variable edge removal and reconnection.
- **Dynamic Edge Selection**: Adapts to dynamically choose edges to remove based on their potential to improve the overall tour distance.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial feasible tour (e.g., generated by a greedy method).
2. **Edge Removal and Reconnection**: Iteratively identify pairs of edges to remove and reconnect to minimize the total distance.
3. **Iteration**: Continue refining the tour until no further improvements can be made.

### Applications

The Lin‚ÄìKernighan algorithm is widely used in various fields, including:

- Logistics and transportation
- Route planning
- Circuit design
- Any domain requiring efficient routing solutions

### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Often finds high-quality solutions in a reasonable timeframe, even for large TSP instances.
- **Flexibility**: The adaptive nature of edge selection allows for more thorough exploration of the solution space.
