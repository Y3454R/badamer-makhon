# My Learning Journal 🥜

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of my daily learnings in technology. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources that reflect my progress and insights.

## 🛠️ CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to manage the build process of software using compiler-independent configuration files. It generates platform-specific build scripts, such as Makefiles for Linux or project files for IDEs like Visual Studio, from a single set of configuration files. I can learn from [here](https://cmake.org/getting-started/).

## 🧠 Keras

Keras is a high-level deep learning API that allows users to easily build, train, and deploy neural networks. It abstracts many low-level details of neural networks and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for complex tasks. [Explore](https://www.notion.so/Keras-e2587ac62cf14f1aa3bf410feaf480b4).

## 🔦 Lidar

Lidar is a method for determining ranges by targeting an object or a surface with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar)

## 🛣️ Lin–Kernighan Algorithm

The [Lin–Kernighan algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic) is a powerful heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This algorithm is designed to find a near-optimal solution through iterative local optimization techniques.

##  🕸️ Darknet
[Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA, designed for both CPU and GPU computing. It’s widely known for powering the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models, which are some of the fastest and most popular real-time object detectors.

## Transfer Learning 
need for LAMAwGUN (automatic dialogue generator from subtitle) implementation.
