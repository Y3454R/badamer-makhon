# My Learning Journal 🥜

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of my daily learnings in technology. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources that reflect my progress and insights.

## 🛠️ CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to manage the build process of software using compiler-independent configuration files. It generates platform-specific build scripts, such as Makefiles for Linux or project files for IDEs like Visual Studio, from a single set of configuration files. I can learn from [here](https://cmake.org/getting-started/).

## 🧠 Keras

Keras is a high-level deep learning API that allows users to easily build, train, and deploy neural networks. It abstracts many low-level details of neural networks and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for complex tasks. [Explore](https://www.notion.so/Keras-e2587ac62cf14f1aa3bf410feaf480b4).

## 🔦 Lidar

Lidar is a method for determining ranges by targeting an object or a surface with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar)

## 📊 Ling Cardinal Algorithm
The Ling Cardinal algorithm is a method used in machine learning and statistics, particularly for estimating the parameters of a probabilistic model. It's often associated with estimating the probabilities of different outcomes based on observed data.

While specific details might vary, the algorithm generally focuses on:

Parameter Estimation: Using observed data to update estimates of model parameters.
Bayesian Framework: It can be implemented within a Bayesian context, where prior beliefs about parameters are updated with new data.
