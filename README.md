# My Learning Journal 🥜

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of my daily learnings in technology. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources that reflect my progress and insights.

## 🛠️ CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to manage the build process of software using compiler-independent configuration files. It generates platform-specific build scripts, such as Makefiles for Linux or project files for IDEs like Visual Studio, from a single set of configuration files. I can learn from [here](https://cmake.org/getting-started/).
